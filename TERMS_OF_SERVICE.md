# Terms of Service

_Last updated: 2025-08-04_

Welcome to **MNDiscordBot** ("the Service", "the Bot", "we", "us", or "our").  By inviting, installing, or otherwise using the Bot in your Discord server or direct messages (collectively, "Guilds"), **you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service** ("Terms").  If you do not agree with these Terms, do not use the Service.

## 1. Description of the Service
MNDiscordBot is a hobby & open-source Discord integration that tracks users’ public Spotify listening activity, generates daily summary "wrap-ups", and provides music-related utilities (e.g. `/listen`, `/chat`, profile images).  The Service is provided free of charge on an "AS IS" basis.

## 2. Eligibility
You must be at least 13 years old—or the minimum age of digital consent in your country—to use Discord and this Service.  By using the Service you represent that you meet this requirement.

## 3. Relation to Discordʼs Policies
Your use of the Service is also governed by [Discord’s Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).  These Terms supplement, and do not replace, those documents.

## 4. Acceptable Use
You agree **not** to:

1. Violate any applicable law or regulation.
2. Harass, abuse, or harm another user.
3. Attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Bot or its infrastructure.
4. Reverse-engineer, decompile, or modify the Bot beyond what the open-source licence allows.
5. Use the Bot to infringe on intellectual-property rights.

We reserve the right to suspend the Service in any Guild or to any user that breaches these Terms.

## 5. Privacy & Data
Use of the Bot is subject to our [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY_POLICY.md), which describes what data we collect and how we handle it.

## 6. Availability & Modifications
We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service at any time, with or without notice, including to perform maintenance or to address security concerns.

## 7. Termination
You may cease using the Service at any time by removing the Bot from your Guild or, for user-specific data, by issuing the `/disconnect` command.  We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED **“AS IS”** AND **“AS AVAILABLE.”**  WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 9. Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED USD 50 OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US (IF ANY), WHICHEVER IS LESS.

## 10. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Service, its contributors, and maintainers from any claim or demand arising out of your use of the Service or your violation of these Terms.

## 11. Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of **[Your Country / State]**, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions.  You consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in those courts.

## 12. Changes to These Terms
We may revise these Terms from time to time.  Material changes will be announced in the Bot’s support server or via an in-bot notice.  Continued use of the Bot after such changes constitutes acceptance.

## 13. Contact Us
For questions about these Terms, please contact **<avery.kwok05@yahoo.com>**.
